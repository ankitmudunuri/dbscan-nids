# Multithreaded NIDS with DBSCAN Anomaly Detection (Proof of Concept)
## A proof-of-concept to help secure networks from malicious activity

#### This is still a work-in-progress, but it reads and clusters packet data in order to see if there are any outliers or small numbers of packets from sources that are outside of the clusters (noise or packets from unknown or malicious actors).

#### This script is run by just running main.py in the main parent directory of the project, I will work on making a better entrypoint into the program
